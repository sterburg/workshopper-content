## Lab: Canary Release to Production

### Background: Canary Release

Each application has different requirements for availability (and other considerations) during deployments. 
OpenShift Container Platform provides strategies to support a variety of deployment scenarios. 

A https://{{DOCS_URL}}/latest/dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.html#rolling-strategy[rolling] 
deployment slowly replaces instances of the previous version of an application with instances of the new version of the application. 
A rolling deployment typically waits for new pod to become ready via a readiness check before scaling down one of the old pods. 

The https://{{DOCS_URL}}/latest/dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.html#recreate-strategy[Recreate] 
strategy has basic rollout behavior and supports lifecycle hooks for injecting code into the deployment process.
This process will first bring down all old instances, then execute lifecycle hooks (e.g. database schema updates), 
then start all new instances at once.

In OpenShift Container Platform the rolling (canary) strategy is the default.


#### Live Deployment

The default behavior for OpenShift has every
https://{{DOCS_URL}}/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html[build] 
creating a new Docker image with the `latest` tag set. Since we do not want to immediately run or
deploy the *Live* version of `nationalparks` when the `latest` image changes, we want the
ability for the *Dev* and *Live* deployments to run different versions of the
`nationalparks` image simultaneously. This will allow developers to continue
changing and deploying *Dev* without affecting the *Live* environment. 

We've used the template parameter APPLICATION_STAGE=live at our new-app creation in the link:templates[previous labs].
This created a Deployment with a trigger based on image changes on only the "live" tag.

----
oc get template nationalparks -o yaml
    {
      "kind": "DeploymentConfig"
      "spec": {
        "triggers": [
          {
            "type": "ImageChange",
            "imageChangeParams": {
              "from": {
                "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
                "name": "${APPLICATION_NAME}:${APPLICATION_STAGE}"
              }
            }
          }
        "template": {
          "spec": {
            "containers": [
              {
                "name": "${APPLICATION_NAME}-${APPLICATION_STAGE}",
                "image": "${APPLICATION_NAME}:${APPLICATION_STAGE}"
              }
            ]
        }
      }
    }

We've created the *Live* environment based on the same `nationalparks`
Docker image created in link:java[previous labs]. Click on *Builds* &rarr;
*Images* and then `nationalparks` to inspect the *ImageStream*.

In order to deploy the `live` application all we need to do is trigger 
its image-change event by tagging the image with a `live` tag.
We will point this `live` tag to an earlier image version that we've deemed 'OK'.
In our case the version we build before we made the code change earlier.

[source]
----
oc describe is/nationalparks
oc tag nationalparks@sha256... nationalparks:live
----

You should have seen a change on the *ImageStream* page in the UI.

While _new_ builds will update the `latest` tag, only a manual command (or an
automated workflow, like we will implement with Jenkins) will update the `live`
tag. The `live` tag keeps referring to the pervious Docker image and therefore
leaves the *Live* environment intact from *Dev* changes.

#### A/B Testing

By deploying the new image to production you have completely retired the old 
version and all visitors are served the new version. Perhaps this is not what 
you want, but you want to slowly introduce the new feature and monitor the 
business impact. OpenShift Container Platform supports A/B Testing by creating 
one route (url) that can route to two different services. 
You can then slowly increase the percentage of routing to the new version.


#### Exercise:

Go to *Applications* -> *Routes* and click on `nationalparks-live`. Edit the route

Make Router to do round robin

[source]
----
oc annotate route/nationalparks-live haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance=roundrobin
----

Test the route

[source]
----
for i in {1..10}; do curl nationalparks-live-explore-XXX.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/ws/info/ ; echo "" ; done
----


Open parksmap in Chrome > Incognito or Firefox > New Private Window in order to disable caching. Refresh
the page a few times and you should see every few requests the name of nationalparks in the right top menu changes.
