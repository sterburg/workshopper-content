## Lab: OpenShift Role-Based Access Control

### Background

Almost every interaction with an OpenShift environment that you can think of
requires going through the master's API. All API interactions are both
authenticated (AuthN - who are you?) and authorized (AuthZ - are you allowed to
do what you are asking?).

There are two types of clients that connect to the master's API:

* Users
* Service Accounts

Just like a user has permissions (AuthZ), sometimes we may
wish for non-users to be able to perform actions against the API. These
"non-users" are referred to as service accounts.

Service accounts are local to each project and are meant for processes inside
Pods to be able to authenticate.
While user accounts are meant for humans to interact with multiple projects.

OpenShift automatically creates a few special service accounts in every project.
The **default** service account has its credentials automatically injected into
every pod that is launched. By changing the permissions for that service
account, we can do interesting things.

### Exercise: Inspect Container Logs for Permission errors

If you look at our route parksmap-{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}[parksmap-{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}] we just created,
we don't see any National Parks on the map, which means our application is not 
working as expected.
If we inspect the containers Logs we can see it is a permission error:
The application is trying to query OpenShift for a list of running Database 
Services to connect to.

[source,role=copypaste]
----
oc logs dc/parksmap |grep ERROR
----


### Exercise: Grant Service Account View Permissions
The parksmap application wants to talk to the OpenShift API to learn about other
*Pods*, *Services*, and resources within the *Project*. You'll learn why soon!

[source,role=copypaste]
----
oc project {{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}
----

Then:

[source]
----
oc policy add-role-to-user view -z default
----

The `oc policy` command above is giving a defined _role_ (`view`) to a user. But
we are using a special flag, `-z`. What does this flag do? From the `-h` output:

[source]
----
-z, --serviceaccount=[]: service account in the current namespace to use as a user
----

The `-z` syntax is a special one that saves us from having to type out the
entire string, which, in this case, is
`system:serviceaccount:{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}:default`. It's a nifty shortcut.

[NOTE]
====
The `-z` flag will only work for service accounts in the *current* namespace.
Beware of this if you attempt to use it in the future.
====

Now that the default *Service Account* has **view** access, it can query the API
to see what resources are within the *Project*. This also has the added benefit
of supressing the error message! Although, in reality, we fixed the application.

### Exercise: Grant User View Permissions
If you create a project, you are that project's administrator. This means that
you can grant access to other users, too. If you like, give your neighbor view
access to your `explore` project using the following command:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
oc policy add-role-to-user view user{{SUFFIX}}
----

Have them go to the project view by clicking the *Projects* button and verify
that they can see your project and its resources. This type of arrangement (view
but not edit) might be ideal for a developer getting visibility into a
production application's project.

To see a list of all roles you can assign:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
oc get clusterroles
----

To see details of a specific permissions for a role you can:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
oc describe clusterroles/view
----

### Exercise: Redeploy Application
One more step is required. We need to re-deploy the application because it's
given up trying to query the API.

This time we'll use the web console. Find your `{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}` project,
and then click "Applications" and then "Deployments". You'll see your only
application, `parksmap`, listed. Click that.

The deployment screen tells you a lot about how the application will be
deployed. At the top right, there is a button labeled "Deploy". This button will
cause a new deployment (which you know creates a new *ReplicationController*,
right?).

Click it.

You'll see that a new deployment is immediately started. Return to the overview
page and watch it happen. You might not be fast enough! If you look at the logs
for the application now, you should see no errors.  That's great.
