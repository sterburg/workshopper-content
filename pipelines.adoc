## Lab: Automating Deployment with CI/CD Pipeline

### Background: CI/CD Pipeline
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment refer to a set of practises with
the intention of automating various aspects of delivery software. One of these
practises is Pipeline which is an automated process to define the steps a change
in code or configuration has to go through in order to reach upper environments
such as staging and production. OpenShift supports CI/CD Pipelines by integrating
the popular https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/overview/[Jenkins pipelines] into
the platform and enables defining truly complex workflows directly within OpenShift.

In a previous lab, you deployed the `nationalparks` application using the
https://{{DOCS_URL}}/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[Source-to-Image (S2I)]
mechanism. S2I already provides build automation by automatically running builds
when source code changes, or an underlying image changes. Deployments are also automated
by S2I and can be triggered when the image they are based on changes. In this lab,
you will create a more complex workflow by creating a pipeline that extends the S2I
functionality by adding more steps to the build and deploy process. The following
diagram shows the pipeline you will create in this lab.

image::pipeline-diagram.png[CI/CD Pipeline Diagram,800,align="center"]

There are two environments for the `nationalparks` application in this pipeline.
*Dev* container is for development and test purposes where all code and
configuration changes are deployed so that you can run automated tests against it.
Furthermore, the test teams can run their manual tests on this container and
report any bugs discovered through their test cases. If the tests are all successful
and the _Deployment Manager_ in the team approves the change, it is then deployed to the
*Live* container which is the production environment with defined SLA and is
critical to function properly at all times.

The pipeline execution starts with a developer making a change in the application
code or configuration. For every change, the following steps are executed with the
goal of determining if the change is appropriate for deployment in the *Live*
environment:

. Clone the code from Git repo
. Build the code and run unit tests
. Build a docker image from the code (S2I)
. Deploy the docker image into *Dev*
. Run automated tests against the *Dev* deployment
. Run manual tests against the *Dev* deployment
. Wait for the *Deployment Manager* to either approve or reject the deployment (e.g. manual tests have revealed an unacceptable number of bugs)
. If approved, deploy to *Live*

Let's move on to deploy `Jenkins` and create this pipeline on OpenShift.

### Exercise: Deploy Jenkins

OpenShift provides a supported Jenkins image which includes a rich set of
plugins that enable the full pipeline flow. Click on the *Add to project*
button. Then, scroll down to the *Technologies* section and click on *Continuous
Integration & Deployment*:

image::pipeline-technologies.png[CI/CD Technologies]

Find the `jenkins-ephemeral` template, and click on it:

image::pipeline-jenkins-catalog.png[Jenkins Ephemeral]

You can customize the Jenkins properties such as service name, admin password, memory
allocation, etc through the parameters in the web console. We can leave all of
the default values, so just click on *Create* to deploy Jenkins.

OpenShift deploys a Jenkins pod and also creates a service and route for the
deployed container.

image::pipeline-jenkins-pods.png[Jenkins Pods]

Click on the Jenkins route in order to open the Jenkins Console. 
The Jenkins image that is provided by Red Hat
uses an OAuth integration with OpenShift. Your OpenShift user credentials also
become the admin credentials for Jenkins:

image::pipeline-jenkins-credentials.png[Login with OpenShift]

Click *Login with OpenShift* and you will be taken to an OpenShift-branded login
screen. Use your username (_{{USER_NAME}}_) and password (_{{USER_PASSWORD}}_) to
access Jenkins. You will then be prompted to grant access:

image::pipeline-jenkins-permissions.png[Grant Jenkins Permissions]

Click *Allow selected permissions*.

image::pipeline-jenkins-console.png[Jenkins Console]


{% if DISABLE_NATIONALPARKS_DEPLOYMENT_PIPELINE %}
### Exercise: Disable Automatic Deployment of nationalparks (dev)
When we created the `nationalparks` build earlier in the workshop, OpenShift
configured the deployment of the image to occur automatically whenever the
`:latest` tag was updated.

In our pipeline example, Jenkins is going to handle telling OpenShift to deploy
the dev version of `nationalparks` if it builds successfully. In order to
prevent two deployments, we will need to disable automatic deployments with a
simple CLI statement:

[source]
----
oc set triggers dc/nationalparks --from-image=nationalparks:latest --remove
----

{% endif %}

### Exercise: Create OpenShift Pipeline

The Pipeline is in fact a type of build that allows developers to define a Jenkins
pipeline for execution by the Jenkins pipeline plugin. The build can be started,
monitored, and managed by OpenShift Container Platform in the same way as any other
build type. Pipeline workflows are defined in a Jenkinsfile, either embedded directly
in the build configuration, or supplied in a Git repository and referenced by the
build configuration.

In order to create the pipeline, click on the *Add to project* button,
find the `dev-live-pipeline` template, and click on it. Specify the project name
and click on *Create*

NOTE: Specify the name of the project (e.g. `{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}`) where
`nationalparks` *Dev* and *Live* containers are deployed.

In order to start the pipeline that you created in a previous step, Go to
*Builds* &rarr; *Pipelines* on the left side-bar. Click `nationalparks-pipeline`
and click on *Start Build* to start the execution.  You can click on *View
Log* to take a look at the build logs as they progress through the pipeline or
on *Build #N* to see the details of this specific pipeline execution as well as
the pipeline definition using the
https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/overview/[Jenkins DSL].

image::pipeline-details.png[Pipeline Details]

Because of the way the pipeline was defined, if you return to the overview page
you will also see the pipeline status there, associated with the relevant
deployments:

image::pipeline-deploy-dev.png[Pipeline - Deploy to Dev]

Pipeline execution will pause after running automated tests against the *Dev*
container. Visit the `nationalparks` *Dev* web service to query for data and
verify the service works as expected.

----

After the test stage, pipeline waits for manual approval in order to deploy to the
*Live* container.

image::pipeline-input.png[Manual Approval]

Click on *Input Required* link which takes you to the Jenkins Console for approving
the deployment. This step typically will be integrated into your workflow process
(e.g. JIRA Service Desk and ServiceNow) and will be performed as part of the overall
deployment process without interacting directly with Jenkins. For simplicity in
this lab, click on *Proceed* button to approve the build.

image::pipeline-jenkins-input.png[Jenkins Approval,1000,align=center]

Pipeline execution continues to promote and deploy the `nationalparks` image.
This is achieved by tagging the image that was just built and tested as "live",
which causes the `imagechange` trigger on the *Live* deployment to act. This
likely already happened before you finished reading this paragraph.

In *Builds* &rarr; *Pipelines*, click on *View History* to go to the pipeline overview
which shows the pipeline execution history as well as build time metrics so that you can
iteratively improve the build process as well detect build time anomalies which usually
signal a bad change in the code or configuration.

NOTE: Build metrics are generated and displayed after a few executions of the pipeline
to determine trends.

Congratulations! Now you have a CI/CD Pipeline for the `nationalparks`
application. If you visit the parks map again, you should see the map points!
