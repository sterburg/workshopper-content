## Lab: Scaling and Self Healing

### Background: Deployment Configurations and Replication Controllers

While *Services* provide routing and load balancing for *Pods*, which may go in and
out of existence, *ReplicationControllers* (RC) are used to specify and then
ensure the desired number of *Pods* (replicas) are in existence. For example, if
you always want your application server to be scaled to 3 *Pods* (instances), a
*ReplicationController* is needed. Without an RC, any *Pods* that are killed or
somehow die/exit are not automatically restarted. *ReplicationControllers* are
how OpenShift "self heals".

OpenShift's *HorizontalPodAutoscaler* effectively monitors the CPU usage of the
Pods in your ReplicaSet and then manipulates the RCs accordingly.

### Exercise: Scaling the Application

Let's scale our parksmap "application" up to 2 instances. We can do this with
the `scale` command. You could also do this by clicking the "up" arrow next to
the *Pod* in the OpenShift web console on the overview page. It's your choice.

[source]
----
oc scale --replicas=2 dc/parksmap
----

To verify that we changed the number of replicas, issue the following command:

[source]
----
oc get rc

NAME         DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
parksmap-1   2         2         0         4h
----

You can see that we now have 2 replicas. Let's verify the number of pods with
the `oc get pods` command:

[source]
----
oc get pods

NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
parksmap-1-8g6lb   1/1       Running   0          1m
parksmap-1-hx0kv   1/1       Running   0          4h
----

And lastly, let's verify that the *Service* that we learned about in the
previous lab accurately reflects two endpoints:

[source]
----
oc describe svc parksmap
----

You will see something like the following output:

[source]
----
Name:			parksmap
Namespace:		{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}
Labels:			app=parksmap
Selector:		deploymentconfig=parksmap
Type:			ClusterIP
IP:			172.30.169.213
Port:			8080-tcp	8080/TCP
Endpoints:		10.1.0.5:8080,10.1.1.5:8080
Session Affinity:	None
No events.
----

Another way to look at a *Service*'s endpoints is with the following:

[source]
----
oc get endpoints parksmap
----

And you will see something like the following:

[source]
----
NAME       ENDPOINTS                                   AGE
parksmap   10.1.0.5:8080,10.1.1.5:8080                 4h
----

Your IP addresses will likely be different, as each pod receives a unique IP
within the OpenShift environment. The endpoint list is a quick way to see how
many pods are behind a service.

You can also see that both *Pods* are running using the web console:

Overall, that's how simple it is to scale an application (*Pods* in a
*Service*). Application scaling can happen extremely quickly because OpenShift
is just launching new instances of an existing image, especially if that image
is already cached on the node.

### Exercise: Scale Down

Before we continue, go ahead and scale your application down to a single
instance. Feel free to do this using whatever method you like.
