## Lab: Deploy a Docker Image

### Application description
In this lab, we're going to deploy the web component of the ParksMap application which is also called `parksmap` and uses OpenShift service discovery mechanism to discover the backend services deployed and shows their data on the map.

### Exercise: Deploying your first Image

Let's start by doing the simplest thing possible - get a plain old
Docker-formatted image to run on OpenShift. This is incredibly simple to do.
With {{OPENSHIFT_NAME}} {{OPENSHIFT_VERSION}} it can be done directly from the
web console.

Return to the web console:

*link:https://{{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}[]*

Find your *{{EXPLORE_PROJECT_NAME}}{{USER_SUFFIX}}* project and click it. Next, click "Add to
project" at the top of the screen.

There are several options, but we are only concerned with "Deploy Image". Click
it. We will learn more about image streams and image stream tags later. For now,
select the "Image Name" option, and copy/paste the following into the box:

[source]
----
docker.io/openshiftroadshow/{{PARKSMAP_IMAGENAME}}:{{PARKSMAP_VERSION}}
----

Your screen will end up looking something like this:

image::parksmap-image.png[Explore Project]

WARNING: Verify that the version used is the one in the text, 
not the one in the image as it might be different.

Either press *enter* or click on the magnifying glass. OpenShift will then go
out to the Docker registry specified and interrogate the image. You then are
presented with some options to add things like environment variables, labels,
and etc. -- which we will learn about later.

{% if PARKSMAP_PY %}

For now, change the application name:

image::parksmap-image-options.png[Explore Project]

{% endif %}

Hit the blue "Create" button at the bottom of the screen and then click the
"Continue to overview" link. Take a moment to look at the various messages that
you now see on the overview page.

WINNING! These few steps are the only ones you need to run to get a "vanilla"
Docker-formatted image deployed on OpenShift. This should work with any
Docker-formatted image that follows best practices, such as defining an EXPOSE
port, not needing to run specifically as the *root user* or other user name, and
a single non-exiting CMD to execute on start.


### Exercise: Examining the Pod

In the web console's overview page you will see that there is a single *Pod* that
was created by your actions. This *Pod* contains a single container, which
happens to be the parks map application - a simple Spring Boot/Java application.

image::parksmap-app.png[Parksmap application]

You can also examine *Pods* from the command line:

[source]
----
oc get pod
----

You should see output that looks similar to:

[source]
----
NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
parksmap-1-hx0kv   1/1       Running   0          2m
----

The above output lists all of the *Pods* in the current *Project*, including the
*Pod* name, state, restarts, and uptime. Once you have a *Pod*'s name, you can
get more information about the *Pod* using the *oc get* command.  To make the
output readable, I suggest changing the output type to *YAML* using the
following syntax:

NOTE: Make sure you use the correct *Pod* name from your output.

[source,role=copypaste]
----
oc get pod parksmap-1-hx0kv -o yaml
----

You should see something like the following output (which has been truncated due
to space considerations of this workshop manual):

[source]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/created-by: |
      {"kind":"SerializedReference","apiVersion":"v1","reference":{"kind":"ReplicationController","namespace":"explore-00","name":"parksmap-1","uid":"f1b37b1b-e3e2-11e6-81a2-0696d1181070","apiVersion":"v1","reso
urceVersion":"36222"}}
    kubernetes.io/limit-ranger: 'LimitRanger plugin set: cpu, memory request for container
      parksmap; cpu, memory limit for container parksmap'
    openshift.io/deployment-config.latest-version: "1"
    openshift.io/deployment-config.name: parksmap
    openshift.io/deployment.name: parksmap-1
    openshift.io/generated-by: OpenShiftWebConsole
    openshift.io/scc: restricted
  creationTimestamp: 2017-01-26T16:17:36Z
  generateName: parksmap-1-
  labels:
    app: parksmap
    deployment: parksmap-1
    deploymentconfig: parksmap
  name: parksmap-1-bvaz6
...............

The web interface also shows a lot of the same information on the *Pod* details
page. If you click in the *Pod* circle, and then click the *Pod* name, you will
find the details page. You can also get there by clicking "Applications", then
"Pods", at the left, and then clicking the *Pod* name.

Getting the parks map image running may take a little while to complete. Each
OpenShift node that is asked to run the image has to pull (download) it if the
node does not already have it cached locally. You can check on the status of the
image download and deployment in the *Pod* details page, or from the command
line with the `oc get pods` command that you used before.
